# Intro-to-GitHub

## Description
GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code. Any member of a team can access the GitHub repository (think of this as a folder for files) and see the most recent version in real-time.

Difference between Git and GitHub

Git is the version control system GitHub uses. Git is open source and free to use for small and large projects. It is the system that keeps track of every change you make in GitHub. GitHub, meanwhile, is where people can share and collaborate on the files they have created. GitHub lets you use Git without having to first learn the command codes.
